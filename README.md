# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ludwig

My ultimate goal is to spend my 80,000 working hours with a lasting effect on our world.Â I believe that technology is there to solve problems, so let's start with engineering today, for a better planet.

Currently on a mission to build the largest AI Ecosystem in Europe together with [appliedAI](https://www.appliedai.de/) and [IPAI](https://ip.ai/en/) at Heilbronn. 

I believe in a more enlightened world where there are less prejudices against new perspectives and upcoming technology, so I do my best to contribute to a world where access to high quality educational content is not restricted to the priviledged only. Doing so by contributing to Open-Source projects.

Too keep things DRY I have compiled an overview about my current projects at my [website](https://ludwigstumpp.com). Happy to see you there!
