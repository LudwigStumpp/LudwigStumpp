# Hi, I'm Ludwig ðŸ‘‹
I use Github to make my contribution to a more educated world. Especially in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I notice the superficiality of society. There is much more than just empty hype. To call everything artificial intelligence is easy, but not to understand the manifold technologies behind it.
